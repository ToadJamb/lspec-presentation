Intro / Goals
- Ass
- goal of this presentation
- IE7
- examples will contain code structured as I believe it should be, not as examples you will find.
- encourage feedback - questions, agreements, disagreements.


getting started
- setup
- controllers
- services / factories
- ng-repeat
- resource?


what's wrong?
- controllers are global functions.
- syntax could be cleaner.
- very little standardization
- overuse of $scope, $resource, etc. in examples
- select directive - object OR set initial value
